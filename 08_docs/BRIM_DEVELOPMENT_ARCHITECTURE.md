# BRIM development architecture

## Purpose

This document records durable application and development contracts. It does not replace current code, registries, schemas, or focused tests; those remain the highest technical authority.

## Application boundary

BRIM is a self-contained Leaflet HTML application built primarily through R/htmlwidgets. It combines:

- Local embedded/reference datasets;
- External on-demand web services;
- Ops Live/current-condition feeds;
- upload/measure/draw utilities;
- legends, filter/explorer cards, hover, and popups.

These families have different data-loading and lifecycle contracts. Do not move a layer between them merely to simplify implementation.

## Registry-driven design

A user-facing layer should have one maintained definition for:

- identity/display name/order/group;
- source and semantic key;
- style tokens;
- legend/filter/search behavior;
- hover/popup composition;
- counts;
- lifecycle ownership;
- source/provenance links.

Map styling, legend swatches, filter ordering, category labels, and counts should derive from the same definition. Avoid duplicate constants and geometry-order-dependent styling.

## Descriptive layer catalog boundary

`08_docs/catalog/BRIM_LAYER_CATALOG.csv` is currently a descriptive metadata mirror only (`CATALOG_AUTHORITY=DESCRIPTIVE_ONLY`). Current runtime, build, and controller source does not consume the catalog; the existing R/Leaflet/htmlwidgets/JavaScript construction remains authoritative (`RUNTIME_AUTHORITY=UNCHANGED`).

The current catalog and `qa/test_descriptive_layer_catalog.R` parity test retain the six-record HUC proof (`huc2`, `huc4`, `huc6`, `huc8`, `huc10`, and `huc12`) and the four-record heterogeneous proof: ordinary Local `gw_bull118`, External `EXT143`, Ops Live `ops_u_s_drought_monitor`, and custom-controller `usgs_streamgages`. The tested descriptive population also includes 16 diversity-selected records spanning ordinary and custom Local layers, shared and custom-loader External resources, and hosted-vector, raster/image, observational, and forecast Ops Live products.

The resulting 26-record population exercises the unchanged 15-field descriptive schema across simple overlays, shared search/filter/card behavior, combined and virtualized custom controllers, tiled and image services, bespoke External loading, product-specific status/error lifecycles, and nontrivial clear/reset ownership. This establishes `SCHEMA_DIVERSITY_PROVEN=YES` for the selected records and permits future descriptive population to proceed incrementally without another proof-only schema worker.

This boundary does not claim that all 276 visible BRIM layers are cataloged or validated, authorize catalog-driven rendering, replace custom controllers, resolve External lifecycle gaps, normalize Ops Live status semantics, or confirm producer-side contracts. The proof-role classification remains separate from each record's catalog architecture.

## Semantic features and geometry components

Normal UI counts represent semantic user-facing features unless a layer contract explicitly chooses another primary unit. Geometry components/parts remain internal QA and rendering detail.

Bounds, selection, chips, and zoom operate on the complete semantic feature across all components.

## Shared Local Reference interaction contract

The accepted Local Reference framework supports layer-specific enablement of:

- concise safe hover;
- structured/tabbed popup cards;
- semantic counts;
- category filters;
- single- and multi-valued facets with OR semantics within a facet;
- optional layer-specific quick views that set an approved facet value;
- autocomplete and removable named-feature chips;
- staged Apply and immediate Auto modes;
- separate Auto-zoom and Zoom to results;
- detached/docked cards;
- idempotent layer-off/Clear Local/Clear All teardown.

New Local Reference layers should extend the shared registry/controller/helpers rather than fork them. Category filters are added only when the source supports meaningful stable categories; search/selection may be the primary control for otherwise neutral layers.

Filter-aware Local Reference labels use the same applied semantic and geometry
IDs as the rendered map; staged state is never a second visibility truth.
Cache records supply stable semantic/component anchors, while the controller
only selects among them. See
`08_docs/features/LOCAL_REFERENCE_SEMANTIC_LABELS.md`.

California ACECs use this same contract. Their category filter is intentionally
hidden because all 238 current source records share one designation type;
meaningful filtering instead uses value-family, planning-framework, and
spatially derived current field-office-context facets. The unchanged ACEC
source administrative-unit coding remains separately visible in the popup;
field-office intersection is not presented as management responsibility. The
six value-family colors are
centralized in the ACEC facet registry: one applied family uses its thematic
color, while the default, DRECP-only, and multi-family states use the neutral
ACEC style. See `08_docs/features/ACEC.md`.

## Popup contract

- Compose trusted BRIM-owned structure from individually escaped values.
- Suppress empty labels, rows, sections, and tabs.
- Use accessible semantic controls and keyboard operation.
- Keep header/tabs visible; use content-driven height up to a viewport cap and internal scrolling only for genuinely long content.
- Recalculate after disclosure open/close and meaningful width changes.
- Tab changes do not pan/zoom or recreate geometry.
- Narrative interpretation/policy language requires traceable provenance and attribution; BRIM's own voice should be limited to neutral data, map, currency, access-verification, and limitation statements.

## Lifecycle and ownership

Every layer/controller must have one authoritative ownership model for all Leaflet objects and UI resources.

Layer-off and the relevant clear actions must remove:

- base/filtered/replacement geometry;
- selected/hover highlights;
- popups/tooltips;
- cards and temporary DOM;
- LayerGroups/FeatureGroups added to the map;
- listeners, observers, timers, animation frames, and deferred callbacks;
- stale registry/controller references and staged/applied selection state.

Teardown is idempotent and safe after partial initialization. Repeated off/on cycles must not duplicate geometry, cards, or listeners.

## Styling and color semantics

Color meaning is layer-specific. Agency colors are opt-in only when verified management agency is the approved primary color basis. Trail/unit identity, status, recommendation, region, or neutral styling may be more appropriate.

Missing/shared/unknown states need explicit stable treatment. Colors and patterns are provisional until reviewed on BRIM basemaps.

## Management and provenance

Designation, administration, local management, partners, BLM role, office responsibility, and data stewardship are separate fields. Publication or spatial intersection alone does not prove management authority.

User-facing narrative and management claims retain evidence, verification date, scope, and confidence. Technical provenance should be available without overloading the initial popup.

## Performance and payload

- Precompute stable display fields during processing/cache stages rather than doing joins or geometry work on hover.
- Keep browser payloads compact; do not ship full research workbooks/registers.
- Use bounded on-demand loading for External layers.
- Preserve complete retrieval before swap; failures should retain the prior successful snapshot where applicable.
- Avoid duplicate geometry, labels, hidden copies, and unbounded listeners.
- Test realistic HTML size, browser responsiveness, and narrow viewports.

## Build and environment separation

Author in the lean source repository, integrate/test in `codex_ship`, and deploy to production only after merge and backup. See `BUILD.md`.

## Testing standard

A feature is not complete until focused tests prove:

- exact identity/join/count contracts;
- source-value preservation;
- style/filter/search/chip/zoom behavior;
- hover/popup safety and accessibility;
- idempotent lifecycle/clear behavior;
- sibling cache/layer integrity;
- realistic mounted-browser behavior;
- human visual acceptance;
- production smoke acceptance after deployment.
